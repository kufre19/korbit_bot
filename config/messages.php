    "about_us" => <<<MSG
    Korbit Arbitrage scanner provides crypto traders with an opportunity to capitalize on price differences across multiple 
    trading platforms. By aggregating market data from numerous crypto exchanges, this app offers valuable insights on optimal
    buying and selling points. Traders can leverage this information to identify opportunities to buy at low prices and sell 
    at high prices, maximizing their potential profits.
    
    Our innovative bot enables users to profit from price differences between exchanges without the need to hold tokens in 
    advance. By leveraging real-time market data, our bot identifies favorable trading opportunities, allowing users to execute
    trades and capitalize on price differences for maximum profitability. This approach eliminates the need for upfront token 
    investments, providing a flexible and efficient arbitrage solution for traders.
    
    The principle is very simple: you purchase a coin on one exchange and transfer it to another where the price is higher. Once
    the coin arrives at the second exchange, you can sell it and generate a profit from the price differential. By leveraging 
    this simple strategy, our bot enables users to take advantage of market inefficiencies and maximize their potential earnings 
    through arbitrage trading.
    
    Currently, the biggest differences are between different blockchains, Other websites or bots do not display this difference, 
    making this the goldmine and the perfect opportunity to make some serious profits.

    relevant to your trading strategy. Our platform aggregates data from more than 65 exchanges, providing you with a
